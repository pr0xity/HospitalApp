# Problem statement
Inspiration for the problem is taken from the website of St. Olavs Hospital (https://stolav.no/).
The model we are going to work with in this assignment is simplified to be adapted to the syllabus and the time frame in
this submission.


Definition taken from Store Medisinske Leksikon (https://sml.snl.no/sykehus): \
*Hospital is a health institution approved for hospitalization, examination and treatment of patients and mothers
women who need specialized health care. The hospitals include wards, outpatient clinics and
laboratories. Traditionally, a distinction has been made between somatic hospitals, which mainly treat
diseases of the body, and psychiatric hospitals, which treat mental disorders. This distinction is off
less important now in that psychiatric wards are often included as part of the total
the hospital offer.*


In this assignment, you will only work with one hospital. One hospital object consists of a list of
departments and is identified by a name. Each department further consists of a list of employees and one
list of patients. Employees can be further categorized as health personnel and other employees.
Healthcare professionals are limited to general practitioners, surgeons and nurses. Only GPs and surgeons
can diagnose a patient. You should not create a complete client in this task, but one
simplified version specified in task 5.
